**Warning: If you break your system by blindly copying and pasting commands, it is not my fault.**

**This is just my way of doing this. It works for me, but I can't guarantee it will work for you.**

This is a guide to set up Snapper on Arch Linux for Btrfs if you use the Archinstall suggested partition layout. I will walk you through the process of installing Snapper with that layout **ONLY**.

## Dependencies

+ [snapper](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/snapper/) (Needed)
+ [btrfs-assistant](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/btrfs-assistant/) (Recommended)
+ [snap-pac](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=snap-pac) (Recommended)
+ [grub-btrfs](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=grub-btrfs) (Optional)
+ [snap-pac-grub](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/snap-pac-grub/) (Optional)
+ [refind-btrfs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/refind-btrfs/) (Optional)

I usually just install most of them like this:
```
yay snapper btrfs-assistant snap-pac grub=btrfs snap-pac-grub
```


## First step

Delete pre-mount snapshots:

```
sudo umount /.snapshots
sudo umount /.snapshots
```

This is needed because it will allow the user to use Snapper to make a new config.

## Second step

Create a config with Snapper:

```
sudo snapper -c root create-config /
```

Remove existing snapshots:
```
sudo btrfs subvolume delete /.snapshots
sudo mkdir /.snapshots
```

Mount it:
```
sudo mount -a    
```

## Last step

List all subvolume:
```
sudo btrfs subvol list /  
```

Set @ as default:

```
sudo btrfs subvol set-default 256 /
sudo btrfs subvol get-default /  
```

It should be all good now. If you run into any issues, you can try reading the following resource:
